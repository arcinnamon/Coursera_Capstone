    "The client is confident that a new pizza restaurant will be successful given that (1) there is no nearby competition from existing pizza restaurants and (2) there is good online exposure of other businesses in the neighborhood. The client's reasoning is that a \"pizza-underserved\" area would benefit with a single pizza restaurant (theirs) rather than multiple competitive restaurants and that increased online exposure is important because the client believes that internet searches are the primary way consumers learn of new businesses."

The client's reasoning is that a \"pizza-underserved\" area would benefit with a single pizza restaurant (theirs) rather than multiple competitive restaurants and that increased online exposure is important because the client believes that internet searches are the primary way consumers learn of new businesses."

Neighborhoods with a frequency of 0 denote neighborhoods without pizza restaurants. These are the \"candidate\" neighborhoods for the rest of the analysis.\n",

The five neighborhoods with the lowest pizza restaurant frequencies and the highest like counts will be the neighborhoods recommended to the client."

    "The iterative approach in the Discussion section (working with neighborhoods with non-zero pizza place scores) revealed two candidate neighborhoods that I would have recommended alongside St James Town from the first analysis. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the priority of client's criteria. That is, would the client accept a recommendation of a neighborhood with an existing pizza restaurant that has a higher online exposure value via likes than multiple neighborhoods with zero pizza places? A more in-depth analysis could have weighted pizza restaurant frequency and online exposure via likes for relative importance. This probably would have elevated the Adelaide/King/Richmond and Berczy Park neighborhoods if online exposure were weighted more than the number of existing pizza restaurants in each neighborhood. A weighting approach would be more important especially if more decision criteria were provided by the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data sources could have been used to identify additional pizza restaurants that Foursquare couldn't, but there might not have had a common set of venue categories. Having to map categories from two disparate data sources would have added a level of uncertainty into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A population and/or population density dimension would also help analyze the recommended neighborhoods. Population data could help determine if like counts are driven by locals or visitors."
